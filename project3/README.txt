Any commands mentioned in this readme are in quotes, but should be typed in and executed without the quotes.

1. Compile the program by opening terminal/command prompt in the folder with the .c, .h, and makefile files and 
entering "make all". To clean the compiled program and any related object files, do the same thing, and enter 
"make clean".

2. To run the program, after it has been compiled, type "./project3" in the terminal/command prompt, and then follow 
the instructions. The program will request you to enter the trace level. Alternatively, to run the program with the 
trace level as a command line argument, type "./project3 1" in the terminal/command prompt. The program should run 
after completing either of the previous steps.
